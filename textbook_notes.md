# 1. The Golem of Prague
A golem is a clay robot from Jewish folklore constructed out of dust, fire, and water. It is brought to life by inscribing "emet", or truth, in Hebrew on its brow.
It is animated by truth but, lacking free will, it does exactly what it is told.
The golem is incredibly powerful and can accomplish what its creators cannot do, but its obedience can be destructive if its given careless instructions or encounters unexpected events.
"Its abundance of power is matched by its lack of wisdom"

One legend derived in the Jewish tradition states that Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel created a golem to protect the Jews in Prague. When animated with truth and ordered to defend the Jewish people, it killed innocent people. The rabbi had to decomission the golem.
Statistical golems do not understand cause and effect.  They only understand association.

*Hypotheses are not models!*
When we attempt to falsify a hypothesis, we must work with a model of some kind. Even when the attempt is not explicitly statistical, there is always a tacit model of measurement, of evidence, that operationalizes the hypothesis.

We must be careful when creating a model so that our work acts not with vague boundaries brought on by verbal conjecture by instead developed as a precise model of behavior.

Remember, statistical models do not embody specific causal relationships!

How do we get a statistical model from a causal one? We can derive the expected frequency distribution of some quantity (or statistic) from the causal model.
1. Any given statistical model (M) can correspond to more than one process model (P)
1. Any given hypothesis can correspond to more than one process model (P)
1. Any given statistical model (M) may correspond to more than one hypothesis (H).

A null model is NOT unique to any process model nor hypothesis.
-- Confused by this part... aren't we investigating a particular question, therefore hypothesis, with a particular null model? Aren't our hypotheses explicit in that way? Or should they be?

Explicitly compare predictions of more than one model, and you can save yourself from some ordinary kinds of folly!

Process models allow us to design statistical models with the problems of unobserved variables and sampling bias in mind. The statistical model alone is not enough to account for these problems!

Exponential family of distributions: Normal, binomial, Poisson, etc:
Nature loves these distributions because nature loves entropy. These distributions are all "maximum entropy distributions".

Falsification: we have a hypothesis H and we show it entails an observation D. We then look for D and, if we don't find it, we must conclude that H is false. This is known as "modus tollens" meaning method of destruction in Latin.
IF we find D, we're told nothing certain about H because other hypotheses might also predict D. No number of observations can prove the null hypothesis true. It takes only one observation to prove it false.

However, seeking disconfirming evidence is important, but it cannot be as powerful as the swan story appears. Most problems scientists tackle are not as logically discrete. Instead, we most often face two simultaneous problems that make the swan fable misrepresentative.
-- Observations are prone to error! Especially at the boundaries of our knowledge.
Most hypotheses are quantitative and concern degrees of existence, rather than discrete, concerning total presence or absence.
-- Need Avi to explain what this means... at some point we have to make a discrete decision about what we're looking at right?
